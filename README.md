# Discord-RMA
This repository is dedicated to keeping the DISCORD RMA bot and server transparent. Everytime something small or large is updated/added/removed it will be announced. (Kinda like an audit log)
The DISCORD RMA bot is a discord bot that notifies server owners if a member in their community has been reported in their or other servers, the bot connects servers kinda like a network.
